The Jupyter notebook contains code to predict Singapore's monthly Consumer Price Index via univariate time-series modelling. I explore the use of autoregressive, moving average, and ARMA models; model identification is achieved via the Box-Jenkins method.

Data obtained from Singstat Table Builder. CPI data spans from January 1961 to December 2017.
